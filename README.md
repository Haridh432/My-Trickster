# MyTown Trickster Game Website

## Overview

This repository contains the files and resources for the **MyTown Trickster Game Website** project. This project was developed as part of a university assignment, where I was tasked with creating a multi-page game website for a fictional game company. The website is fully responsive and includes interactive elements, custom form validation, and a polished UI/UX design created in Figma.
